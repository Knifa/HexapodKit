\chapter{Implementation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This chapter will document the implementation process of the robot's systems.

\section{Hardware Operation}

% FIXME: Maybe put this elsewhere?
From the outset, it was known that the depth sensor relied on the \emph{OpenNI2} library and already had a supporting package. However, no such packages existed for the servo controller.

\section{Locomotion}

Strictly, only joints 1 and 2 are necessary for a tripod gait. Joint 3 can be locked, perhaps as a single solid piece of material, such that a right angle is formed between the foot and leg sections. This provides a stable stance for the robot to balance upon as it pushes itself forward between each cycle.

\section{Sensing}

openni2 originally, ccny\_rgbd \cite{ccny_rgbd} provides some clean up features.

\subsection{Visual Odometry}

ccny\_rgbd \cite{ccny_rgbd} was used.

\subsection{Environment Mapping}

ocotomap

\subsubsection{Alternatives}

SLAM, but expects laser scan.

\section{Navigation}

Built in stack.
