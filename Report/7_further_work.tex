%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Improved Hardware}
Servos are absolutely terrible.

\section{Untethered Operation}
Raspberry Pi as hardware controller. Passed to base station for processing, cloud. Multiple robots sharing sensor data.

\section{Inverse IK}
More accurate walk cycle. Advanced movement, tilting. Sweeping.

\section{Additional Sensors}
Accelerometers for automatic calibration, odometery. Distance sensors as insect-like feelers. Use of microphones on Xtion.  

\section{Facial Recognition}
ROS already has packages for this. More complex behaviour in general.
